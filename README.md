# Reminderer

A reminder bot for [Discord]. Focused on privacy, because people who use it as a second brain likely care.

**Reminderer is still under initial development, so GitHub Issues is disabled.**

<!-- **If you are having issues, please contact me [on Discord][contact-discord].** -->

## To-Do

- [ ] parse "when" parameter
      (will use java bridge with [prettytime](https://www.ocpsoft.org/prettytime/)
      or find a way to use [recurrent](https://github.com/kvh/recurrent))
- [ ] set up timed reminder system
      (maybe use a serverless function for this)
- [ ] explore deployment options
      (maybe use a serverless function for command triggers too)
